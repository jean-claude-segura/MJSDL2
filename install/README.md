For those who don't know how to or want to build, there is an exe in the install directory. Just get the directory from the repo and play!

But, keep in mind that I built it on my system and even if I assume it's virus free, I can't be absolutly sure.

To build : SDL2 and SDL2_image in SDL and SDL_image directories at the same level than MJSDL2 directory. The solution should find them with the relative path.

To run : SDL2.DLL and SDL2_image.dll needed.
